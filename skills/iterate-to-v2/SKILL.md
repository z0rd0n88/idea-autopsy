name: iterate-to-v2
description: Translate a critique (from stress-test-idea, evaluate-proposal-harsh, or manual review notes) into a concrete change plan for v2 of an idea doc, proposal, pitch deck, or spec — section-by-section edits, things to cut, things to add, things only the founder can provide, and an explicit rejection log for findings the user disagrees with. Each change recommendation is required to name what it REMOVES, not what it hedges. Default acceptance is bucket-aware (auto-accepts Consensus + real-Unique from stress-test output, Critical + High from verdict output) instead of accept-all. Use whenever the user has a critique in hand and wants to draft the next version — including "iterate this", "apply this critique", "draft v2", "rewrite based on this", "turn these findings into changes", "what should I actually change", "next version of this doc", "close the loop". Scope is product/business proposals.

# Iterate to v2

## `-h` / `--help`

If the argument text (trimmed, case-insensitive) is exactly `-h`, `--help`, or
`help`, output only the block below and stop — do not run any other step in this
skill.

Translates a critique of a doc, proposal, pitch deck, or spec into a concrete
v2 change plan — section-by-section cuts, replacements, and additions, with a
rejection log for findings the user disagrees with. Reach for it once a v1 doc
and its critique (from `stress-test-idea`, `evaluate-proposal-harsh`, or a
human reviewer) are both in hand; without a critique to translate, run one of
those first instead.

| Option | Values | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<doc>` (v1) | file path or pasted text | required | The document to iterate on. |
| `<critique>` | file path, pasted text, or inline findings | required unless loaded via `--slug` state | The critique translated into the change plan. |
| `--slug <name>` | string | derived from doc filename | Locates/creates `./.autopsy/<slug>/`; if state has both a v<N> doc and critique, loads them without re-pasting. |
| `--accept-all` | flag | off | Forces accept-all regardless of bucket-aware detection. |
| `--accept-none` | flag | off | Produces a rejection log only; v2 = v1. |
| inline accept/reject decisions | free text naming a finding + reason | none | Overrides the bucket-aware default for that finding; always wins over defaults. |
| inline constraints / context | free text (e.g. "must stay under 2 pages") | none | Shapes the change plan without altering acceptance logic. |

Translate a critique into a concrete change plan for the next version of a doc. The skill produces actionable edits — what to cut, what to rewrite, what to add — not a wholesale auto-rewrite. The founder owns the voice and the final text; this skill is the bridge between critique and the founder's keyboard.

This skill exists because the most common failure mode after a harsh critique is "patching" — sprinkling defensive language throughout v1 to acknowledge each weakness without actually resolving any of them. Patched docs get longer and weaker. Iterated docs get shorter and sharper. The skill is designed to push the user toward iteration, not patching, by making every recommendation declare *what it removes*.

## Scope

Designed for **product and business proposals**. The critique-format detection (Consensus / Unique / Verdict headers) is tuned to outputs from `stress-test-idea` and `evaluate-proposal-harsh`. Manual or human critique notes work too — they fall back to bucket-unaware acceptance with a note recommending the user pass bucket overrides.

## Confidentiality

This skill does NOT fan out to subagents — it runs on the main thread. The doc and critique stay in the parent context. Lower confidentiality risk than `stress-test-idea` and `evaluate-proposal-harsh`.

## When to use

The user has two things: (1) a doc they wrote, and (2) a critique of that doc — from `stress-test-idea`, `evaluate-proposal-harsh`, a human reviewer, or their own notes. They want to know what to actually change in v2.

Triggers:
- "Apply this critique" / "iterate this" / "draft v2"
- "What should I actually change in this doc"
- "Turn these findings into edits"
- "Close the loop on this stress-test"
- Sharing a doc plus a critique and asking for next steps

If the user only has a doc and no critique, point them at `stress-test-idea` or `evaluate-proposal-harsh` first. This skill needs critique input — without it, there is nothing to translate.

## Inputs

Required:
- The original document (v1) — file path or pasted text
- A critique of that document — file path, pasted text, or inline list of findings; OR a slug whose state directory contains both

If `./.autopsy/<slug>/state.json` exists and contains both a v<N>.md and v<N>-stress-test.md (or v<N>-verdict.md), the user can invoke with just `--slug <slug>` and both inputs will be loaded from state.

The critique can come in any format. Common formats:
- Output from `stress-test-idea` (consensus/unique/contradictions/iteration recommendations)
- Output from `evaluate-proposal-harsh` (axis findings + verdict + multiplicity table)
- A human reviewer's notes
- The user's own bullet points
- A meeting transcript with feedback

Parse what you can. Do not enforce a specific critique format.

Optional, inline:
- Accept/reject decisions on specific findings ("reject the TAM finding — I have a reason to believe it")
- The user's own additional context ("I've decided to pivot to enterprise")
- Constraints on the rewrite ("must stay under 2 pages", "must keep the existing structure")
- `--accept-all` / `--accept-none` to override bucket-aware defaults
- `--slug <name>` for state-directory location

Do not ask follow-up questions before running. If the user has provided a doc and a critique, produce the change plan. If they have given accept/reject decisions, honor them. If they haven't, apply the bucket-aware default (see below).

## The change-vs-hedge principle

This is the load-bearing rule. Read it before producing any output.

**A finding is "addressed" when the doc no longer makes the problematic claim, not when the doc acknowledges the problem.**

Examples:

| Finding | Hedge (wrong) | Change (right) |
|---|---|---|
| TAM is unsupported fantasy | Add caveat: "While our TAM estimate is preliminary..." | Delete the TAM section; replace with bottom-up sizing of one specific beachhead segment |
| No evidence users will pay | Add section: "User research is ongoing" | Cut the price-point claim; add: "Pricing TBD pending paid pilots" |
| Regulatory risk unaddressed | Add disclaimer: "We acknowledge regulatory complexity" | Either resolve the regulatory question or remove the feature that depends on it |
| Team lacks domain experience | Add line about "ongoing learning" | Reframe team section around the experience that IS relevant, or add an advisor who has it |
| Hockey-stick revenue projection | Add footnote: "Aggressive assumptions" | Replace the projection with a single conservative line item the founder can defend |

The pattern: **hedging keeps the bad content and apologizes for it; change removes or restructures the bad content.** A v2 that addresses critique through hedging is worse than v1, because it now contains the same weaknesses plus more text.

**Every change recommendation in the output MUST declare what it removes via a required `Removes problematic claim by:` field.** That field is the enforcement mechanism for the principle. A "Removes by:" entry that itself describes a hedge ("adding a caveat that…", "noting that…", "acknowledging…") is forbidden and must be revised before output.

## Bucket-aware default acceptance

If the user has not given explicit accept/reject decisions, the default behavior depends on the critique format detected.

### Detection

Scan the critique input for these headers (case-insensitive):

| Header pattern | Detected format |
|---|---|
| `## Consensus findings` AND `## Synthesis` | `stress-test-idea` output |
| `## Verdict` AND (`## Critical thinking` OR `## ROI signal`) | `evaluate-proposal-harsh` output |
| Neither | Unknown format |

### Default acceptance rules

**If `stress-test-idea` output detected:**
- Default-accept:
  - All Consensus findings (any severity)
  - Unique findings explicitly annotated `(real)` or with no annotation
- Default-defer:
  - Unique findings explicitly annotated `(likely reach)`
  - Speculative additions in "What none caught" / "What neither caught"
- Default-reject: none (deferred is the strongest non-acceptance the default applies)

**If `evaluate-proposal-harsh` output detected:**
- Default-accept: Critical findings, High findings
- Default-defer: Medium findings (unless 3+ Medium findings cluster within a single axis — then accept the cluster)
- Default-reject: none

**Provenance modifier (v1.2.0 outputs, both formats):** if findings carry provenance tags, prefer `[verified]` findings, and treat a `[reviewer-inference]` finding the review's verification pass could not confirm the same way as a `(likely reach)` — default-defer it rather than default-accept, even at high severity. A claim the reviewers asserted from outside knowledge but nobody verified should not silently drive a v2 rewrite.

**If unknown format:**
- Default-accept: all findings (legacy behavior)
- Print a note at the top of the output: "Critique format not auto-detected. Accepting all findings. To weight by confidence, re-invoke with bucket annotations or accept/reject decisions."

**Override:** `--accept-all` forces accept-all regardless of detection; `--accept-none` produces only a rejection log + `v2 = v1`.

The rationale for bucket-aware defaults: `stress-test-idea` synthesis explicitly distinguishes consensus (high confidence) from unique-reaching (likely false positive). The old "accept all" default treated those as equivalent, undoing the prior skill's filtering work. Bucket-awareness restores that signal.

## Workflow

Six steps: slug-and-state, read-and-size-check, parse, classify, plan, format-and-write.

### Step 0 — Determine slug and ensure state directory

If the user supplied `--slug <name>` or the doc came in as a file path, derive a slug like the other skills.
- If `./.autopsy/<slug>/state.json` exists, load it. Use it to locate v<N>.md and v<N>-stress-test.md/v<N>-verdict.md if the user didn't paste them inline.
- If state.json doesn't exist but the user provided both inputs inline, create a state directory and snapshot v<N>.md (the doc) into it on output.

### Step 1 — Read both inputs and size-check

Read v1 and the critique. Apply the doc-size guard to the **combined word count** of doc + critique:

| Combined words | Action |
|---|---|
| < 8000 | Proceed normally |
| 8000 – 20000 | Warn; offer to focus only on Consensus/Critical findings to keep the change plan focused |
| > 20000 | Refuse; ask for excerpt of doc or summary of critique |

The plan's output has a ceiling too: the next stage (`evaluate-proposal-harsh` or `stress-test-idea`) refuses above 15,000 words. Note v1's word count now; a plan whose net effect would push v2 over that line has failed its own change-vs-hedge rule, because a doc that grew is a doc that was patched.

Note in working memory:
- v1's section structure
- v1's central thesis and supporting claims
- The critique's findings, organized by what they target in v1

### Step 2 — Parse findings into a normalized list

Regardless of critique format, normalize each finding to:
- What it claims is wrong
- Where in v1 it lives (which section/claim/number)
- Severity if stated (Critical / High / Medium); otherwise infer
- Bucket tag if detected (Consensus / Unique(real) / Unique(reach) / Speculative / Verdict-Critical / Verdict-High / Verdict-Medium / unknown)
- Provenance tag if present (`[verified]` / `[doc-claim]` / `[reviewer-inference]`) — v1.2.0 review outputs carry these

If two findings target the same v1 element, merge them, keeping the highest severity and unioning bucket tags.

### Step 3 — Apply acceptance defaults + user overrides

Apply the bucket-aware defaults from above. Then layer user accept/reject decisions on top — they always win.

A "reject" decision should include the user's reason. If they rejected without a reason, do not invent one — note the rejection in the rejection log with `(user did not state reason)`.

### Step 4 — Classify each accepted finding into a change type

Five types, in rough order from most disruptive to least:

1. **Cut** — delete the affected content. Used when a section, claim, or number is so unsupported that no rewrite saves it.
2. **Pivot** — restructure around a different positioning, beachhead, or thesis. Used when the critique reveals the doc is making the wrong argument.
3. **Replace** — swap the affected content for something defensible. E.g., replace fantasy TAM with bottom-up sizing; replace projected ARR with a single committed pilot.
4. **Add** — introduce new content that v1 was missing. Used when the critique exposes an unaddressed risk or unaccounted-for cost.
5. **Refine** — sharpen existing content without changing the substance. Used only for medium-severity findings where v1 is mostly right but needs precision. **Use sparingly — Refine is the change type most prone to becoming a hedge.**

If a finding could be addressed by any of these, default to the most disruptive option that resolves it. Cut beats Pivot beats Replace beats Add beats Refine. Erring toward disruption produces shorter, sharper docs.

### Step 5 — Render the change plan and write to state

Use the output format below. Write the rendered plan to `./.autopsy/<slug>/v<N>-change-plan.md`. Update state.json with the new artifact and a history entry.

Before writing, total the plan: words cut minus words added, against v1's count. If the estimate exceeds 15,000 words, report it in the plan header as a failure and cut further — the next stage will refuse the result. The plan also states its **landing condition**: what gets written back to the source path when v2 survives review, and what happens to the live document's header if it does not (a superseded note, or nothing). Name any intermediate the loop produced (excerpts, superseded versions) as prunable, or the repo keeps three copies of a document whose verdict was "don't build this".

## Output format

Use this structure exactly. Do not add sections, do not change headings.

```markdown
# v2 change plan: [doc title or filename] (from v[N])

State: `./.autopsy/[slug]/v[N]-change-plan.md`

## Acceptance summary

- Critique format detected: [stress-test-idea | evaluate-proposal-harsh | unknown]
- Accepted: N findings (M auto, K user-confirmed)
- Deferred (bucket-defaults / user choice): K findings
- Rejected by user: J findings

(If critique format was unknown: "Critique format not auto-detected — accepted all findings by default. Re-invoke with bucket annotations for finer control.")

## Changes by section

### [Section name from v1]

- **Type:** Cut | Pivot | Replace | Add | Refine
- **Change:** one-sentence description of what to do
- **Removes problematic claim by:** one sentence naming the SPECIFIC deletion or restructuring — e.g., "deleting paragraph 3 of section X", "replacing the TAM figure with bottom-up math", "cutting the price assertion entirely". This field is REQUIRED and may NOT describe a hedge (no "adding a caveat that…", "noting that…", "acknowledging…").
- **Addresses:** finding citation(s) from the critique, including bucket tag
- **Proposed text or structure:** (only if useful — short draft, outline fragment, or numbers framework. Otherwise omit.)
- **Needs your input:** (only if applicable — specifically what the founder must provide that the skill cannot generate, e.g., a real customer name, a verified number, a chosen pricing tier, or a fundamental business decision)

(repeat for each affected v1 section)

## Sections to cut from v2

- **[Section name]** — which finding(s) made it obsolete; one-sentence rationale; cite the deletion that addresses each finding.

## New sections needed in v2

- **[Section name]** — what it covers, which finding(s) made it necessary, what the founder needs to fill in.

## Deferred findings (bucket-defaults)

- **[Finding]** — deferred because: [reason from bucket-default rule, e.g., "marked `(likely reach)` in source critique" or "Medium severity, no axis cluster"]. Re-evaluate if the user upgrades severity or moves it out of the deferred bucket.

(repeat for each deferred finding; omit section entirely if nothing was deferred)

## Rejection log

- **[Finding]** — rejected because: [user's reason, or "user did not state reason"]
- **In v2, this means:** how (if at all) the doc should acknowledge or defend the rejected position. If no acknowledgment needed, write "no change to v2 from this rejection."

(repeat for each rejected finding; omit section entirely if nothing was rejected)

## Suggested v2 outline

A numbered list of sections in the order they should appear in v2. Mark each section as:
- *[unchanged]* — keep v1 content as-is
- *[edit]* — apply changes from "Changes by section" above
- *[new]* — write from scratch per "New sections needed"
- *[cut]* — section is removed

This is the founder's checklist for the rewrite.

## Next step

After v2 is drafted, save it as `./.autopsy/[slug]/v[N+1].md` and run `stress-test-idea` (or `evaluate-proposal-harsh` if approaching a decision) on it to verify the changes resolved the findings without introducing new weaknesses. The loop closes when a stress-test pass returns mostly Medium findings or empty critical findings, or when an evaluate pass returns Invest — and the landing condition above then runs: the surviving version is written back to the source path, and the intermediates are pruned.
```

## Examples

**Change recommendation — good**

> ### Market sizing
>
> - **Type:** Replace
> - **Change:** Delete the $12B TAM claim and the chart that derives it. Replace with a bottom-up estimate for the institutional crypto trader beachhead: count of US institutional desks (~200), realistic addressable share at year 1 (~5%), monthly ARPU at proposed price ($2k), implied year-1 ARR ($240k).
> - **Removes problematic claim by:** deleting the entire "Market opportunity" section and the chart on slide 4; replacing them with one paragraph stating the beachhead segment, the math, and the load-bearing assumption.
> - **Addresses:** Consensus [Critical] — TAM unsupported (stress-test Reviewer A fermi mismatch + Reviewer B business-model FAIL + Reviewer C unnamed assumption)
> - **Proposed structure:** One paragraph stating the beachhead segment, the math, and the single most important assumption the math depends on.
> - **Needs your input:** The actual institutional desk count for your geographic focus, and the proposed monthly price — both should be researched/decided before drafting v2.

**Change recommendation — bad (this is a hedge masquerading as a change)**

> ### Market sizing
>
> - **Type:** Refine
> - **Change:** Add a caveat to the TAM section acknowledging it is preliminary and based on top-down assumptions.
> - **Removes problematic claim by:** adding a caveat noting the TAM is preliminary.
> - **Addresses:** [Critical] TAM unsupported.

Why bad: the "Removes by:" field describes adding text, not removing the broken claim. The TAM number is still in v2. Reject this and produce the Replace version above.

**Rejection log entry — good**

> - **[High] Doc assumes regulatory pathway is feasible without naming the specific approval needed** — rejected because: I have a verbal confirmation from a regulator that the existing exemption applies; I did not include this in v1 because the source is confidential.
> - **In v2, this means:** Add one line stating that "regulatory pathway has been validated with counsel" without naming the source. Do not provide more detail. If a reviewer asks for evidence, that question is answered offline.

## Edge cases

- **Critique format is non-standard or messy:** parse what you can, normalize into the internal finding list, proceed. Default to unknown-format accept-all behavior with the bucket-override note.
- **Critique contradicts itself:** flag the contradiction at the top of the output (before "Acceptance summary") and ask the user to resolve it before running again. Do not produce a change plan based on contradictory inputs.
- **Findings recommend opposite changes (e.g., one says cut a section, another says expand it):** treat as a contradiction, flag, ask user to choose.
- **User rejects all findings (or `--accept-none`):** produce a rejection log only, note that v2 = v1, and gently suggest that if every finding feels wrong, the critique may have been miscalibrated or the user may not be ready to iterate yet.
- **Critique has no actionable findings (e.g., entirely abstract praise or vague concerns):** flag that the critique is insufficient input; ask for a sharper critique or recommend running `stress-test-idea` to generate one.
- **User wants a wholesale rewritten v2, not a change plan:** comply, but include a header note: "This draft is a starting point. The founder should own final voice and verify all claims." Apply the same change-vs-hedge principle throughout the rewrite.
- **Doc is short (<500 words) and critique is also thin:** the right output is usually "expand v1 with concrete claims first, then critique-and-iterate." Surface this rather than producing a thin change plan.
- **User has run multiple critiques (e.g., both stress-test-idea and evaluate-proposal-harsh):** synthesize across them. Consensus findings across critiques are strongest signal — treat them as the highest-priority changes; apply bucket-aware defaults to each critique independently and union the accepted sets.
- **State.json missing but slug provided:** if user passes `--slug` but no state.json exists, treat as fresh — create the dir and snapshot inputs as v1.

## What not to do

- Do not produce hedges. Re-read the change-vs-hedge principle if tempted.
- Do not output a recommendation whose `Removes problematic claim by:` field begins with "adding…", "noting…", "acknowledging…", "mentioning…", or any other verb that describes inserting apologetic text rather than removing the bad content. Revise to a real change.
- Do not auto-write v2 unless explicitly asked. The default output is a change plan; founders own the rewrite.
- Do not fill in "Needs your input" fields with invented data. If the founder needs to provide a real customer name, leave the field for them.
- Do not bury rejected findings. The rejection log is part of the output; the user's "no" matters as much as their "yes."
- Do not soften severity. If the critique flagged something as Critical, the change plan treats it as Critical.
- Do not pad the change plan to look thorough. If only 3 sections need changes, the output has 3 sections.
- Do not include a "Strengths" or "What's working" section. The user is iterating; positives don't drive v2.
- Do not summarize the doc or the critique back to the user before the plan. Both inputs are in their context already.
- Do not invent findings that weren't in the critique. The skill is a translator, not a critic.
- Do not silently apply accept-all when the critique format is detectable — bucket-aware default is the new behavior and must be respected when detection fires.
- Do not skip writing to `./.autopsy/<slug>/`. The state file IS the loop closure.
